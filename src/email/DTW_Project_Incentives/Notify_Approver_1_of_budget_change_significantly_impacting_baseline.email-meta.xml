    <subject>DTW Alert: Change in project budget impacts Deliver to Win incentive baseline</subject>
    <textOnly>Please be advised that the recent change in the budget for {!EnrollmentPlan__c.EnrollmentApplicationNameUnique__c} project has adjusted the baseline GM% for this Deliver to Win enrolled project by &gt;1%.  This means that the threshold GM% required to earn an award has also changed by &gt;1%.  If you would like to revisit the baseline GM% for the project, please click the link below.  If you do not wish to revisit the baseline GM%, no action is required at this time.  For more information about adjusting the baseline GM%, visit the XXXX training module.
