    <textOnly>Deliver To Win PM/Approver,


Please be advised that the recent change in your project budget &lt;&gt; has adjusted the baseline GM% for your Deliver to Win enrolled project by &gt;1%.  This means that the threshold GM% required to earn an award has also changed by &gt;1%.  If you would like to revisit the baseline GM% for the project, &lt;&gt;.  If you do not wish to revisit the baseline GM%, no action is required at this time.  For more information about the DTW incentive plan, visit the DTW webpage.
