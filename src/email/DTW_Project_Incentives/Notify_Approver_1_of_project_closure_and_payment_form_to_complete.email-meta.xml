    <subject>DTW Action Required: Deliver to Win payment request ready for your submission</subject>
    <textOnly>A project enrolled in Deliver to Win has closed and requires your review for award eligibility.  A payment form may or may not have been generated prior to this notification.  Please visit the hyperlink below to visit the incentive project page, and reference the most recent enrollment application, change form, or payment request.  If a payment request has not yet been generated, you can initiate one at this time.

Once a payment request has been initiated, locate the Final Incentive Information section and check Final Incentive Pool @ ITD.  If an incentive pool was earned, please review the operational metrics and determine a final incentive pool. Once the final incentive pool is determined, allocate final awards for participants.  For more information please review the Approver Resources on the DTW webpage.  A short video and more information about the plan are available.
